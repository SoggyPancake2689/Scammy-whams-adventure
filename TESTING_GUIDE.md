# Game Testing and Error Fixes

## ✅ **Error Prevention Measures Added:**

### 1. **Canvas and Context Validation**
- Added checks to ensure canvas element exists before getting 2D context
- Added error handling for canvas context creation failures
- Game will show error message if canvas is not available

### 2. **DOM Element Validation**
- Added null checks for all DOM element access in UI manager
- Added warnings for missing elements instead of silent failures
- Protected against missing buttons, score displays, and screen elements

### 3. **Class Loading Validation**
- Added checks to ensure all required classes are loaded before game initialization
- Validates that CONSTANTS object is available
- Prevents runtime errors from missing dependencies

### 4. **Event Listener Safety**
- Added checks for button existence before adding event listeners
- Protected against missing difficulty buttons or game control buttons
- Added error handling for keyboard and mouse events

### 5. **Browser Compatibility**
- Added fallback for `roundRect` method (not available in all browsers)
- Used standard `rect` method as fallback for obstacle rendering
- Ensured compatibility with older browsers

## 🧪 **Testing Files Created:**

### 1. **test.html** - Comprehensive Test Page
- Visual test interface with status indicators
- Checks for all required DOM elements
- Validates canvas context availability
- Shows console errors in real-time
- Lists all expected features for verification

### 2. **run_game.bat** - Easy Launch Script
- Simple batch file to open the game
- Provides instructions if manual opening is needed
- Cross-platform compatible

## 🔧 **Potential Issues Fixed:**

1. **Canvas Context Errors** - Now handled gracefully with error messages
2. **Missing DOM Elements** - Added null checks and warnings
3. **Class Loading Issues** - Validates all dependencies before initialization
4. **Browser Compatibility** - Added fallbacks for newer Canvas API methods
5. **Event Handler Errors** - Protected against missing buttons/elements
6. **Initialization Failures** - Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

## 🎮 **How to Test:**

### **Method 1: Direct File Opening**
1. Double-click `index.html` to open in your default browser
2. The game should load automatically with the main menu

### **Method 2: Test Page**
1. Double-click `test.html` for comprehensive testing
2. Check the status indicators for any issues
3. Follow the testing checklist provided

### **Method 3: Batch File**
1. Double-click `run_game.bat`
2. The game will open automatically

## 🐛 **If You Encounter Issues:**

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12) for any error messages
2. **Try Different Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
3. **Check File Paths** - Ensure all files are in the same directory
4. **Disable Extensions** - Some browser extensions can interfere
5. **Check JavaScript** - Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

## 📋 **Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Main menu loads with difficulty selection
- ✅ Diamond appears with glow and rotation effects
- ✅ Obstacles spawn with random themes
- ✅ Particle effects work (sparkles, impacts)
- ✅ Background animates (clouds, stars)
- ✅ High scores save and load correctly
- ✅ All three difficulty levels work
- ✅ Controls respond (spacebar/click)
- ✅ Game over screen shows correctly

The game is now robust with comprehensive error handling and should work reliably across different browsers and systems!
